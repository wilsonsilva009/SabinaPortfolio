            <p>
                Hello, I’m the one who can’t land a job even at McDonald's. 
                Been to like 5 stage interviews for them and even did 5 demonstrations of my work
                only for them to reject me and still use my art. But cool, I guess. Clown school 
                didn’t prepare me for this level of jokes.

            <label>My life</label>
            <p>
                My life is as big of a disaster as my unemployment. Every time I try to get a job, 
                I get the same speech: “Sorry, but we’re looking for someone... less... you." I swear
                they can be more toxic than my ex best friend who friend zoned me. At least he wanted
                someone like me who was not.. me?
            </p>

        <div class="description">
            <label>My tools</label>
            <p>
                I’ve got the essentials. One computer, blender, a dream and tons of piwo. They say dreams 
                can become reality and it is true, since even in my dreams I get rejected! Always 
                the same god damn email "Unfortunately... We've decided to hire the cousin of the CEO instead."

        <div class="description">
            <label>More about me</label>
            <p>
                So, more about me? I’m basically a walking rejection letter. They said McDonalds
                hires literally anyone but guess I'm no one. I tried to move into other stuff, 
                but apparently being good at modeling doesn't make me good at serving drinks. 
                Shocking. You know what else is shocking? Our sponsor, RAID: Shadow Legends.
