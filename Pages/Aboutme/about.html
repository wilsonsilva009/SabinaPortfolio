                Yeah, so I’m like this horse, but not just any horse. 
                I’m the kind of horse that accidentally trips over its 
                own tail while trying to catch a butterfly. I don't know why, 
                but I always think the butterfly is a snack, or whatever. My mane? 
                It’s constantly messy because brushing it is, like, way too much effort.

            <p>
                I mostly spend my days wandering around in circles because, let’s be real, 
                straight lines are overrated. I also have a talent for accidentally walking 
                into fences and knocking over feed buckets. It's a gift, I guess. You could 
                say my life is a series of unfortunate clumsiness, mixed with a weird obsession 
                for chewing on random objects—like, you ever tasted a fence post? Those things 
                are delicious fr fr.

                Horseshoes? Yeah, I wear them ironically. I'm not even sure if they help me or 
                if they just add extra noise to my endless stomping around. My tail is basically 
                my Swiss Army knife. I use it to swat flies, whip myself in the face 
                (by accident), and sometimes I try to lasso stuff with it, but that’s usually a 
                disaster. Just like my life, have I told you about that yet?

            <p>
                Oh, and did I mention I have this weird thing where I snort uncontrollably 
                at the worst moments? Like when someone’s trying to ride me, and boom, snort! 
                They’re on the ground. It’s hilarious, really. Anyway, I also have this 
                irrational fear of puddles. I’ll just stand there, staring at the water like 
                it’s some kind of deep, dark abyss. You know, the usual stuff.
